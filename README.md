# Masonry images

This is my simple example of using masonry.js with pony images taken from PonyWeb API

You can click on image to change it's size

## This is what I used here:

### CSS: 

[Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com)

### JS:

[Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com) -
[Github](https://github.com/desandro/masonry)

[Axios](https://axios-http.com) -
[Github](https://github.com/axios/axios)

[JQuery](https://jquery.com)

### Images:

~~[PonyWeb.ml API](http://ponyweb.ml)~~
> PonyWeb.ml is not working anymore, but probably in the future it may change.

[Wishy](https://wishiy.com)

> It's not really the best way of using this api, but it works.
