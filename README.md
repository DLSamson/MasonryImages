#masonry

This is my simple example of masonry.js with pony images and gifs

You can change your images, just put them int media/ folder

This is what I used here:

[Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/)
[Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/)

You can easily start php localserver
```bash
php -S localhost:8080
```
And go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
